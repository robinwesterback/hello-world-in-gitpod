# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

You can find the link to the website [here](https://robinwesterback.github.io/hello-world-in-gitpod/)

The website is made using HTML and CSS. The primary techniques used to build this website is the: 

+ The anchor element
+ The image element
+ The nav element
+ The unordered lists element 
+ Creating a class with the value of "card"
+ General styling of every element 

To create the website I followed instructions given in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course. A final touch to the website would be to at least replace the images with better fitting images.

Thank you for reading!
